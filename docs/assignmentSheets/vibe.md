# Assignment: Vibe Coding with GenAI - Building Software in the Age of AI

## Assignment Overview

In this assignment, you will practice "vibe coding" - the modern software engineering approach of orchestrating and integrating AI-generated code. You'll build a complete website by directing multiple AI assistants, learning how to effectively prompt, evaluate, integrate, and refine AI-generated code through a CI/CD pipeline. This simulates real-world GenAI-augmented development workflows.

**Points:** 100  
**Focus:** GenAI Integration, Prompt Engineering, Code Synthesis, CI/CD

---

## Learning Objectives

By completing this assignment, you will:
- Practice prompt engineering with multiple AI platforms
- Learn to evaluate and integrate code from different AI sources
- Understand the strengths and weaknesses of different AI coding assistants
- Develop skills in AI-assisted rapid prototyping
- Experience the vibe coding workflow: prompt → evaluate → integrate → refine
- Practice version control with AI-generated code

---

## What is Vibe Coding?

**Vibe coding** is the practice of developing software by:
1. **Directing** AI assistants through natural language prompts
2. **Evaluating** generated code for quality and suitability
3. **Integrating** code from multiple AI sources
4. **Refining** the combined result through iteration

You become the conductor of an AI orchestra, focusing on high-level design and quality control rather than writing every line yourself.

git commit -m "Initial commit: Document AI stack"
git push origin main
```

---

## Part 2: AI-Assisted Development (40 points)

### Requirements for Your Website
Your website must be **substantive** and include:
- Minimum 3 interconnected pages
- Interactive JavaScript functionality
- Responsive design
- A clear theme/purpose (portfolio, game, tool, business site, etc.)

### Step 2.1: Generate Code with AI Assistant #1 (15 points)

**Choose your first AI assistant** (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Copilot, Perplexity, etc.)

**Prompt Strategy Examples:**
- "Create a [type] website with [specific features]. Include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript..."
- "Build a responsive navigation menu that..."
- "Generate a hero section with..."

**Required Documentation:**
Save your prompts in `prompts/assistant1-prompts.md`:
```markdown
# Assistant 1 Prompts and Responses

## Prompt 1
**Timestamp:** [Date/Time]
**Prompt:** [Exact prompt you used]
**Files Generated:** [List files created]
**Satisfaction Level:** [1-5 stars]
**Notes:** [What worked, what didn't]

## Prompt 2
[Continue documenting each prompt]
```

**Add code with attribution:**
For EVERY file created with AI #1, add a comment header:
```html
<!-- 
AI ATTRIBUTION: Generated by [AI Name]
Date: [Date]
Prompt excerpt: "[First 50 chars of prompt...]"
Modified: [Yes/No]
-->
```

Or for CSS/JavaScript:
```css
/* 
AI ATTRIBUTION: Generated by [AI Name]
Date: [Date]
Prompt excerpt: "[First 50 chars of prompt...]"
Modified: [Yes/No]
*/
```

### Step 2.2: Enhance with AI Assistant #2 (15 points)

**Switch to a different AI platform**

**Integration Strategy:**
- Ask AI #2 to enhance existing features
- Generate complementary components
- Create additional pages or functionality
- Improve styling or add animations

**Example Prompts:**
- "Here's my existing code [paste]. Add a [feature] that..."
- "Improve this CSS to make it more [modern/accessible/animated]..."
- "Add error handling to this JavaScript function..."

**Documentation Required:**
Create `prompts/assistant2-prompts.md` with same format as above.

**Attribution:** Mark all AI #2 code clearly with comments.

### Step 2.3: Complete with AI Assistant #3 (10 points)

**Use a third, different AI platform**

**Final Enhancement Ideas:**
- Performance optimizations
- Accessibility improvements
- Additional interactive features
- SEO enhancements
- Advanced CSS effects

**Documentation Required:**
Create `prompts/assistant3-prompts.md`

**Attribution:** Mark all AI #3 code clearly.

### Step 2.4: Initial AI Integration Commit
After integrating code from all 3 AIs:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial AI integration: Code from [AI1], [AI2], [AI3]"
git push origin main
```

---

## Part 3: Deploy to GitHub Pages (10 points)

### Required Manual Changes (5 commits × 5 points each)

**Commit 1: Fix Integration Issues**
- Resolve any conflicts between AI-generated codes
- Ensure consistent naming conventions
- Fix any broken links or paths
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Manual fix: Resolve integration conflicts and naming consistency"
git push origin main
```

**Commit 2: Improve User Experience**

- Remove redundant CSS/JS
```bash
git commit -m "Manual optimization: Improve performance and reduce file sizes"
```

**Commit 4: Personal Touch**

## Academic Integrity

This assignment encourages AI use but requires:
- **Transparency:** All AI use must be documented
- **Attribution:** All AI code must be marked
- **Reflection:** Your report must be human-written
- **Learning:** You must understand the code you submit

Violations include:
- Using AI for the 5 manual commits
- Failing to attribute AI-generated code
- Copying another student's prompts or report
- AI-generating your reflection report

## Tips for Success

### Prompt Engineering Tips
1. **Be Specific:** "Create a navigation bar with 4 links, sticky on scroll, with hamburger menu on mobile"
2. **Provide Context:** "I'm building a portfolio site that needs..."
3. **Iterate:** "That's good, but can you make the animation smoother?"
4. **Ask for Explanations:** "Explain how this JavaScript function works"

### Integration Strategy
1. Start with the AI that's best at structure/boilerplate
2. Use the second AI for enhancements and features
3. Use the third AI for polish and optimization
4. Keep each AI's code in separate files initially, then merge

## FAQ

**Q: Can I use the same AI company's different products?**
A: No. Each must be a distinctly different platform (not GPT-3.5 and GPT-4).

**Q: What if AI generates broken code?**
A: Document it! This is valuable learning. Fix it in your manual commits.

**Q: Can I prompt AIs to fix each other's code?**
A: Yes! This is encouraged. Document these interactions.

**Q: How much code should come from each AI?**
A: Aim for meaningful contributions from each, roughly 20-40% per AI.

**Q: Can I use AI for debugging during manual improvements?**
A: You can ask for debugging help, but the fix implementation must be manual.

## Final Thoughts

Vibe coding is increasingly how modern software is built. This assignment prepares you for a future where AI assistants are standard development tools. Focus on learning:
- Which AIs excel at what tasks
- How to write effective prompts
- How to evaluate AI-generated code
- When human intervention is necessary
- How to maintain code quality with AI assistance

Remember: You're the conductor, the AIs are your orchestra. The quality of the performance depends on your direction.

Good luck, and enjoy vibe coding! 🎵🤖
